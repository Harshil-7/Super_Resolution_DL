# Super_Resolution_DL

## Overview

This project aims to implement a Super Resolution algorithm using Python. Super Resolution is the process of enhancing the resolution and quality of an image, typically by utilizing deep learning techniques. The goal is to take a low-resolution image as input and generate a high-resolution version of the same image as output.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
- NumPy
- OpenCV

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python
# or
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python
```

## Project Structure

```
super_resolution_project/
|-- images/                       # Place your low-resolution input images here
|-- models/                       # Super Resolution model implementation
|   |-- EDSR_x2.pb
|   |-- EDSR_x3.pb
|   |-- EDSR_x4.pb
|-- Super_Resolution.ipynb        # Main script to run the super resolution algorithm
|-- README.md                     # Project README file
```

## Usage

1. Place your low-resolution input images in the `images` directory.

2. Open the `Super_Resolution.ipynb ` script and set the desired parameters, such as model type (TensorFlow or PyTorch), model hyperparameters, and image paths.

3. Run the `Super_Resolution.ipynb ` script to start the super resolution process.

## Super Resolution Model

The super resolution model is implemented in the `models/EDSR_x4.pb` file. This file contains the architecture of the neural network used for super resolution. You can modify this architecture according to your requirements and experiment with different network architectures.
